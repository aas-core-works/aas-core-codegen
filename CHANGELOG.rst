0.0.1rc1.post1 (2021-12-27)
===========================

* A post release to test the publishing pipeline.

0.0.1rc1 (2021-12-27)
=====================

* The initial release candidate.
  This is actually an alpha release!
  Since the UAG Verwaltungsschale still needs to decide on fundamentals
  of the meta-model (such as basic primitive types) yet, this release
  is only meant for first experimental usage.
