# region Arithmetic

# NOTE (mristin):
# Provide the cases for the generated unit tests of the arithmetic operations.
#
# The meta-model is written in Python, so the Python semantics of the modulo operator
# ``%`` and of the built-in ``abs`` hold for all the generated SDKs. However, the native
# operators and functions of the target languages behave differently in the corner
# cases. Most notably, Python floors the division so that the remainder takes the sign of
# the divisor (``-7 % 3 == 2``), while C#, C++, Go, Java and TypeScript truncate
# the division towards zero so that the remainder of their native ``%`` takes the sign
# of the dividend (``-7 % 3 == -1``).
#
# The generators hence transpile the modulo to helper functions (or library functions
# such as ``Math.floorMod`` in Java) which follow the Python semantics. We generate unit
# tests from the cases below for every SDK so that the clients can look up the behavior,
# and be certain about it.
#
# The expected values are computed by Python itself, so the cases can not diverge from
# the semantics of the meta-model.
